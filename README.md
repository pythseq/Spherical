# Spherical
Spherical is an iterative approach to large metagenome assemblies, designed for clusters where insufficient RAM is available for a straightforward assembly.


For use of Spherical your assembler of choice (velvet, SOAPdenovo2 or ABySS) and aligner (Bowtie2, BWA) must be installed.

Spherical is a pipeline that allows for easy production of high quality assemblies.



Spherical is written in python and requires a few python modules to be installed before use.
The modules used by python that may not be standard include;
numpy
HTseq
